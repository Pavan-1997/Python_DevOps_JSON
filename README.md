# Python_DevOps_JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) manipulation in Python involves working with JSON data, which is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

In Python, you can manipulate JSON data using the `json` module, which provides methods for encoding and decoding JSON data. Here are some common JSON manipulation tasks in Python:

1. **Loading JSON Data:**
   - The `json.loads()` function is used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a Python data structure (usually a dictionary or a list).

   ```python
   import json

   json_string = '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}'
   data = json.loads(json_string)
   print(data)
   ```
